              <h2 class="major">About me</h2>
							<p>I'm Tanner Schafer, a recent graduate of Kansas State University and aspiring front end web developer. I am from a small, Kansas town, but moved to "the little apple" when I started college. I fell in love with everything it had to offer and am now happy to call Manhattan my home. In my free time I enjoy golfing, video games, and spending time with family. I love challenges, solving problems, and experimenting with new technology. 
              <p> After completing my education in May of 2021, I began doing freelance work to further develop my front-end skills. I became passionate about web development after completing a school project for the Kansas Department of Agriculture. I really enjoyed bringing my clients vision to life and experimenting with so many possiblities. I had never done anything quite like it before, and the expirence really insured my path forward.  </p>
